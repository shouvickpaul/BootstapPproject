        <div class="row row-content" style="padding: 10px">
            <p>The current pandemic has placed the whole world at a standstill with nations going into lockdown to stall the virus’s relentless march. Still, there is no specific data on when situations will stabilize. What is certain is that the people are learning valuable lessons through this global crisis, and life after COVID is sure to change for the better. Aristotle, the celebrated philosopher, taught, “It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.” Thus, this is perhaps the right time to look ahead at expected improvements in the post-COVID world.</p>

            <h2>What will surely change</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row row-content">
            <h3>1. An unprecedented toll on healthcare workers</h3> 
            <img src="./Images/doctors-covid-19.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
               During this global tragedy, it’s not only the economy or the population that are being affected but also the healthcare professionals on the frontlines. The latter are enduring extreme work conditions and sacrifices in order to help the infected. Despite a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), they show up to work using DIY-solutions like ski goggles and bin bags with a high risk of being infected. Many are working overtime and witness patient after patient succumb to the disease.   
            </p>
            <h3>2. Diminishing trust in the globalized world</h3> 
            <img src="./Images/covid-19-trust-issues.jpg" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
               In the pre-pandemic globalized world, we enjoyed a certain level of trust we mostly took for granted. We could travel almost without limitations, meet people without restrictions and order products worldwide. This will simply change after billions of people had to stay indoors for weeks. 
            </p>

            <h3>3. Focus on the healthcare system</h3> 
            <img src="./Images/AI-and-COVID.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>It’s tragic how the pandemic highlighted the shortcomings of healthcare systems worldwide. The overburdened hospitals need an upgrade on every level from their infrastructures to their processes. These will be needed to ensure a safe environment for the personnel and patients, as well to better cope with any emergency situations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row row-header" style="padding: 10px">
            <h2>What can change</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="row row-content">
            <p>While we’ll unfortunately witness the toll on our healthcare workers and face reduced trust, other changes could take place depending on countries, duration of lockdowns and even personal experiences. Here are three changes we could see emerge as a result:</p>
            <h3>1. Get your new travel document: the immunity passport</h3> 

            <p>It might even become a requirement to travel to a country. As a matter of fact, it’s already happening. In mid-April, Emirates Airline conducted rapid COVID-19 blood tests on passengers travelling to Tunisia from Dubai. “This will enable us to conduct on-site tests and provide immediate confirmation for Emirates passengers traveling to countries that require COVID-19 test certificates,” reads a statement from the airline company.</p>
            <h3>2. Surveillance as an ongoing public health measure</h3> 
            <p>No one wants to be surveilled, but what if it’s for greater good? That’s what certain governments had to resort to in order to facilitate contact tracing. Countries from Germany through Israel to Singapore are using phone tracking data to locate and alert those who might be infected. South Korea went the extra mile by using CCTV footage and bank transactions in addition to phone use in its tracing process.</p>
            <h3>3. Brand-new habits</h3> 
            <p>Awareness for personal and public hygiene measures saw a surge thanks to the contagion. Health authorities are advocating for regular handwashing with soap for at least 20 seconds. Social distancing measures are in place. People are getting used to wearing facemasks for grocery shopping.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
            <p>As people work together in breaking the chain of coronavirus infection, a better world is emerging. The tough times are sure to pass, leaving behind the wisdom of practicing compassion and caring for what genuinely matters in life, like the welfare of family members. People have realized the need for precautions and are taking steps against future contingencies, to keep the coming generations safe.</p>
